# Stephanie-Jones-Quiz-App

## Description

This project required using javascript to make a quiz app that used a set interval function with a varying amount of time left depending on how the questions were answered. It took so long and I learned so much. Writing functions is the most difficult part but it is getting better. This code gives 4 questions and gives the user a set amount of time to answer them. For each wrong answer given, the time left is reduced. At the end of the game, the user is prompted to enter thier initials and this is stored in local storage and rendered in a list on the screen.
